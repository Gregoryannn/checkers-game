# checkers-game
A simple game built in pure Javascript.

## General rules 
Checkers is played by two opponents on opposite sides of the game board. One player has the dark pieces (usually black); the other has the light pieces (usually white or red). Players alternate turns. A player can not move an opponent's pieces. A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square. If the adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately beyond it is vacant, the piece may be captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it.

Only the dark squares of the checkerboard are used. A piece can only move diagonally into an unoccupied square. When capturing an opponent's piece is possible, capturing is mandatory in most official rules. If the player does not capture, the other player can remove the opponent's piece as penalty (or muffin). And where there are two or more such positions, the player forfeits pieces that cannot be moved. Although some rule variations make capturing optional.[3] In almost all variants, the player without pieces remaining, or who cannot move due to being blocked, loses the game.
